> # Features Left to Implement

<hr>

<h3 align="centre">DOWNLOADS</h3>

- At the moment gallery replaced planned download section and it will be very important part of the MV-HUB. It will be implemented in the future when specific resources will be available.

> # Code and assets structure

<hr>

- __HTML:__

- code was structured with every element apearing in code in the same order as on the page:
- first ther is some kind of template that is common to all pages with sticky navbar on the top and footer on the bottom there is also mobile navbar that is not visible unless screen width is decreased and media querries changing its display status.
- Comments are dividing main sections and were extended to screen width to make easier navigation within code.
- Below you can find image of collapsed main section showing rough structure of html code: 

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/LucasP1vko/MVHUB/blob/main/assets/readme_files/structure_%20html_index.png" width=750px 
    alt= HTML code structure presentation />
</div>

<hr>

- __CSS:__

- CSS is structured with the same system as HTML with common elements being styled on the top part but one more common element Media Querries can be found on very bottom below sub pages styling.
- Comments for specific sections were extended to window width to provide easier navigation.
- Also style areas like Common Elements, Subpages Elements and Media Querries are more 'bold' to make them easier to identify.
- Below you can find animated overview of navigation in CSS code:

> # UX.

<hr>

- Creating MV-HUB started with basic sketch of idea based on resources that in my opinion was essential for users: video tutorials, specifications, downloads of configuration files and gallery. 
- Also channel for communication was essential part for this project to exist as it is focused on quite small community that need to building supporting environment within.
- Pictures used in this project were taken used Nikon N90 by myself.
- Color pallette was generated in <a href="https://coolors.co/">COOLORS</a> and was based on colors used on real device interface to make it strongly connected to it. Below you can find animation showing process of creating color pallette:
<div align="center">

# BUGS

<h3 align="center">Fixed Bugs:</h3>


<h3 align="center">Unfixed Bugs:</h3>

- __Images size in Gallery page__
- The only unfixed bug that I am aware of is image size for gallery page but I left them uncompressed to provide high quality images for gallery so users can enjoy small details and get familiar with different sections of MV8800 interface.



## Credits

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to
use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to
avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

### Content

- The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
- Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from [Specific YouTube
Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media

- The photos used on the home and sign up page are from This Open Source site
- The images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site


Congratulations on completing your Readme, you have made another big stride in the direction of being a developer!

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these
projects will become part of your final portfolio so it‚Äôs important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started
with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write
a Git Commit Message
- Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific
names and sections of content.
- For example, instead of naming an image used ‚Äòimage1.png‚Äô consider naming it ‚Äòlanding_page_img.png‚Äô. This will ensure
that there are clear file paths kept.

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider
reviewing the following list when getting started:
- [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
- [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
- [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle,
take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
