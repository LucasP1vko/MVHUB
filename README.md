> ## Features Left to Implement

<hr>

<h3 align="centre">DOWNLOADS</h3>

- At the moment gallery replaced planned download section and it will be very important part of the MV-HUB. It will be implemented in the future when specific resources will be available.

<hr>

<h3 align="centre">FORUM</h3>

- Forum is another planned feature to the website it is the best solution to get community together and members to communicate and share knowledge with each other. 

<hr>

<h3 align="centre">SEARCH</h3>

- With increasing amount of content page will need system for filtering and easy finding desired materials. It will be easier achieved by adding searching engine than navigating in interface. So it is definatelly feature that will appear with website development.

<hr>


<h3 align="centre">RESPONSIVNESS OPTIMIZATION FOR 4K SCREENS</h3>

- It was not essential at the begining because site is rather addressed for smaller devices popular in music studios but eventually will be upgraded to 4K when more content will be added

> # Code and assets structure

<hr>

<a name="codehtml"></a>

- __HTML:__

- code was structured with every element apearing in code in the same order as on the page:
- first ther is some kind of template that is common to all pages with sticky navbar on the top and footer on the bottom there is also mobile navbar that is not visible unless screen width is decreased and media querries changing its display status.
- Comments are dividing main sections and were extended to screen width to make easier navigation within code.
- Below you can find image of collapsed main section showing rough structure of html code:

    alt= HTML code structure presentation />
</div>

<br>

- [Back to the top ‚òù](#menu)

<hr>

<a name="codecss"></a>

- __CSS:__

- CSS is structured with the same system as HTML with common elements being styled on the top part but one more common element Media Querries can be found on very bottom below sub pages styling.
- Comments for specific sections were extended to window width to provide easier navigation.
- Also style areas like Common Elements, Subpages Elements and Media Querries are more 'bold' to make them easier to identify.
- Below you can find animated overview of navigation in CSS code:

> # UX.

<hr>

- Creating MV-HUB started with basic sketch of idea based on resources that in my opinion was essential for users: video tutorials, specifications, downloads of configuration files and gallery. 
- Also channel for communication was essential part for this project to exist as it is focused on quite small community that need to building supporting environment within.
- Pictures used in this project were taken used Nikon N90 by myself.
- Color pallette was generated in <a href="https://coolors.co/">COOLORS</a> and was based on colors used on real device interface to make it strongly connected to it. Below you can find animation showing process of creating color pallette:
<div align="center">
